While ReflectOS is very new, we are hoping to grow it into a more
community-driven project with opportunities for everyone to contribute to
it's success.  See below for some key ways that you can help out the project.

## Test things out

One of the best ways you can help out is just using the system!  Put it through it paces and let us know what's working well and (especially) what still needs to be improved.

If you have any issues, first check the list of [open issues](https://github.com/Reflect-OS/firmware/issues) to make it's not already captured.  If not, please go ahead and create a new issue (if you have a Github account) or let us know using our [contact form](/contact).

## Suggest a feature

Another great way to contribute is to share your ideas for how to make ReflectOS better - feature enhancements, innovative ideas, etc are all welcome.  You can use the [issues](https://github.com/Reflect-OS/firmware/issues) page share your idea if you have a Github account or reach out using our [contact form](/contact).

## Write some docs

One of the goals of ReflectOS is to make getting started and managing the system as easy as possible.  A big part of this is ensuring a comprehensive set of documentation that helps folks get up and running.  At the bottom of every page in these docs is a link to edit it on Github - and we encourage you do so!  If you don't have a Github account, it's easy to do and as a bonus you can more directly submit bug reports and feature requests.

## Build an Extension

Of course, an amazing way to contribute directly to ReflectOS is to extend the functionality - if you have a cool idea for a new section, layout or layout manager - go build it!  There is a full set of documentation for the [ReflectOS Kernel](https://hexdocs.pm/reflect_os_kernel/) with detailed information on how to get started.  ReflectOS is built on Elixir, Nerves, and Scenic so a little background on those is helpful but not necessary.

If you build something awesome, we highly encourage you to open source it and share it with the community!  Let us know about and it we can share it in the official docs.
