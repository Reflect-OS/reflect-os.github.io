Getting started with ReflectOS is designed to be quick and easy, but you will need a couple of things to get started.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
ReflectOS is very new and hasn't reached a stable v1.0 release.  It is very likely there are still
some rough edges which need to be smoothed out.

If you have any issues, please check out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/reflect-os/firmware/issues).  If you don't see yours, help us out by reporting bugs and other defects on the our [GitHub](https://github.com/reflect-os/firmware/issues) or by using our [contact form](/contact)!

## What you'll need

* **One of the [supported hardware systems](/docs/getting-started/about/#supported-hardware)** .  Basically, a Raspberry Pi :)

* **A microSD card and a microSD card reader for your computer**.  ReflectOS will be installed on the microSD card from your computer.

* **Software to install the firmware on the microSD card**.  We recommend either the official [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) or the [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) tool.  Advanced users/developers may want to check out the [fwup](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup) cli tool.

* **A screen to display the ReflectOS dashboard**.  ReflectOS is optimized for a 1920x1080 resolution display, and works well with the [Vilros Magic Mirror v4](https://vilros.com/products/vilros-magic-mirror-v4).  You can also build your own - it's a really fun project!  Check out the [project ideas](/docs/getting-started/project-ideas/) page for more info.

Have everything ready?  Great - let's get started!

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release of ReflectOS for your hardware from the [downloads page](/downloads/).
2. Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io), or [fwup](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup) to flash the firmware onto your MicroSD card.
3. Insert the MicroSD card into your Raspberry Pi, plug it into the screen, and power it up!
4. Follow the instructions on screen to connect to your wifi network and configure
your system.
5. Once connected to your network, you'll see a QR code on screen which will take you to the ReflectOS web app.  We recommend using the "Add to Home Screen" functionality on your smart phone so the app is easily accessible.

Yes - it is really that simple!
