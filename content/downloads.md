ReflectOS has prebuilt firmware images for most of the available Raspberry Pi boards.  Note that ReflectOS requires internet access, so you'll need the "W" version of the Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi Zero 2.

Raspberry Pi3a and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W use the same chip architecture and are compatible with the same firmware.

ReflectOS is very new and hasn't reached a stable v1.0 release.  It is very likely there are still
some rough edges which need to be smoothed out.

If you have any issues, please check out the list of [open issues](https://github.com/reflect-os/firmware/issues).  If you don't see yours, help us out by reporting bugs and other defects on the our [GitHub](https://github.com/reflect-os/firmware/issues) or by using our [contact form](/contact)!
